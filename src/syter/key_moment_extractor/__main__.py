        "Hi,  my  name's  Jack  Ratzinger  and  I'm  gonna  be  talking  about  how  to  recruit  a  co-founder  and  a  team  for  your  startup.",
        "I'm  gonna  first  give  a  quick  overview  of  what  we're  gonna  talk  about.",
        "We're  gonna  start  out  by  talking  about  the  sorts  of  folks  you  might  be  looking  for  for  your  startup,  and  then  we'll  dive  right  into  tactics  and  approaches  you  can  use  to  get  inbound  interest  in  your  company.",
        "We'll  talk  a  little  bit  about  how  people  get,  how  to  get  people  excited  for  your  startup,  and  then  we'll  talk  about  the  screening  process,  how  to  figure  out  if  someone  is  a  good  match  and  someone  you  should  make  an  offer  to.",
        "We'll  then  cover  how  you  make  an  offer,  and  we'll  wrap  up  by  covering  a  few  specific  issues.",
        "One  is  technical  hiring,  which  can  be  a  little  different  from  more  general  recruiting.",
        "And  finally,  we'll  talk  about  specifically  what  you  should  do  when  you're  looking  for  a  co-founder.",
        "Many  of  the  things  we're  gonna  be  talking  about  are  applicable  to  both  finding  a  co-founder  and  finding  employees,  but  there  are  a  few  specific  issues  that  are  relevant  to  when  you're  looking  for  a  co-founder,  um,  to  be,  uh,  part  of  your  startup.",
        "So  we'll  talk  about  that.",
        "Um,  wanna  go  a  quick  background  on  myself.",
        "Um,  I  am  the  co-founder  of  SeatGeek.",
        "We  are  a  search  engine  for  sports  and  concert  tickets  based  in  New York  City.",
        "This  is  my  third  startup.",
        "And  for  all  three  we've  built  a  team.",
        "So  I  have  some  experience  with  this  at  SeatGeek.",
        "We  have  17  folks,  and,  uh,  I  think  we  have  an  incredible  team  and  I  just  wanna  talk  about  some  things  that  we've  done  that  I  think  have  helped  us  get  there.",
        "Um,  it  is  sort  of  the  overall  thesis  for  this.",
        "One  thing  that's  worth  keeping  in  mind  is  that  recruiting  is  a  lot  of  work.",
        "Some  people  think  that  you  can  raise  money  and  spend  a  few  weeks  building  your  team  and  then  move  on  to  more  interesting  things.",
        "That's  totally  not  the  case.",
        "Recruiting  is  something  that  you're  always  doing.",
        "I,  as  a  co-founder,  probably  spend  regularly  30%  of  my  time  trying  to  find  new  people  to  add  to  our  team.",
        "Um,  but  if  you,  you  know,  it's,  it's  a  lot  of  work  because  it's  such  an  important  thing  to  the  success,  the  success  of  a  startup.",
        "And  if  you  invest  that  time,  then  you  know  the  dividends  pay  off.",
